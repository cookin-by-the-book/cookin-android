So, things are a little wonky.

Should you actually want to run our code in android studio, DO NOT, I repeat **DO NOT** point Android Studio to the root of the project. THIS DOES NOT WORK. To actually open it in Android Studio, you need to open the project in the "cooking_by_the_book"  inside, as in, one level deep. This looks like this: https://i.imgur.com/rIpwCZu.png


## Another Note

Make *SURE* your device emulator is set to a Pixel 3a running API level 30.
